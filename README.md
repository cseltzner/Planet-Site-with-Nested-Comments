# PlanetFacts

PlanetFacts is a site for sharing your favorite facts about your favorite planets! The site shares a small overview of the planet, but what is most exciting is that users can register and post their own planet facts, like other user's facts, and comment on their posts, similar to a site like Reddit.

## Purpose
I am making this site to practice the MERN stack, as well as Typescript. Most of the technology stack I have never used before, or have limited experience with, so this project is excellent practice for working through the entire process on my own.

## Technology stack
This project uses the MERN stack along with Typescript, TailwindCSS, React Router, Redux, and the database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
